### **2. Gathering Relevant Data**

Before embarking on the SWOT analysis, ensure you collect accurate and comprehensive data related to your business and its operating environment. Utilize market research, customer feedback, financial reports, and competitor analysis to gather relevant information.

### **3. Conducting the SWOT Analysis**

To conduct the analysis, assemble a diverse team of stakeholders to gain various perspectives. Collaboratively, consider each aspect of the SWOT matrix and thoroughly discuss your company's internal and external factors.
